Her debut album, *Pink Friday* (2010), was a major success, topping the Billboard 200 and receiving platinum certification. The single "Super Bass" became one of the best-selling songs in the US.

                In 2012, her second album, *Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded*, also achieved success, with the hit "Starships" standing out.
