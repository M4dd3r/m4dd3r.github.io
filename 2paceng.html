            <div class="inttxt">Tupac Shakur (Lesane Parish Crooks; June 16, 1971 â€“ September 13, 1996), known as 2Pac or Makaveli, was an American rapper, actor, and social activist, considered one of the greatest and most influential rappers of all time. With over 75 million copies sold worldwide, his songs addressed themes such as violence, racism, social inequality, and the challenges of growing up in the ghettos.

                Tupac began his career as a roadie and dancer before gaining fame with the group Digital Underground. He later excelled as a solo artist but faced legal issues, including a sexual abuse conviction and a fierce rivalry between East and West Coast rap. After being released from prison with Suge Knight's help, he recorded three albums with Death Row Records.
                
                In 1996, Tupac was shot in Las Vegas and died six days later at the age of 25. In 2017, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, becoming the first solo rapper to receive the honor. After his death, he was revered as one of the greatest rappers in history.
