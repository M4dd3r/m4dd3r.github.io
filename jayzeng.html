            <div class="inttxt">JAY-Z (Shawn Corey Carter) is an American rapper, songwriter, producer, and entrepreneur, considered one of the most financially successful artists. He was the first rapper to reach a net worth of $1 billion and is currently estimated to be worth over $2 billion. With more than 125 million albums sold and 24 Grammy Awards, he holds the record for the most albums by a solo artist on the Billboard 200. JAY-Z is also an influential entrepreneur, co-owner of the 40/40 Club, co-founder of Rocawear, and founder of Roc Nation, having invested in various industries including cannabis and sports.

                Born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1969, Jay-Z had a tough childhood, being involved in drug dealing. It was in his teenage years that he fell in love with music, and after rap battles and collaborations with other artists, he gained prominence in the late 1990s. His stage name is a tribute to his mentor Jaz-O and the J/Z subway line in Brooklyn.
                
                In his personal life, JAY-Z married Beyonc√© in 2008, with whom he has three children. In addition to his music career, he had a famous rivalry with Nas, which was resolved in 2005. JAY-Z remains a central figure in music and business, maintaining his relevance over the decades.
